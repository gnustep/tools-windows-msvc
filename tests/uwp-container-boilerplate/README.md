# UWP Container Boilerplate
Microsoft is increasing the security of the Windows platform. Features such as named pipes are disabled on generic executables, and only enabled when packaged as a uwp container.

## How to use this Boilerplate
1. Replace the GNUstepUWPTest.exe.stub with a real executable and rename it to `GNUstepUWPTest.exe`.
2. Enable the Windows developer mode
3. Execute `Add-AppxPackage â€“Register AppxManifest.xml` in a Windows Powershell
4. Open `GNUstepUWPTest` from Windows Start
